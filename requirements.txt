# IMPORTANT FOR WINDOWS USERS:
# Installing llama-cpp-python can be complex. For GPU acceleration (NVIDIA),
# it is highly recommended to install it manually *before* running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
# Open a command prompt and run these commands, replacing with your CUDA version if needed:
#   set CMAKE_ARGS="-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on"
#   set FORCE_CMAKE=1
#   pip install llama-cpp-python --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall
# If you do not have an NVIDIA GPU or do not want GPU support, the standard pip install may work,
# but you might need the Visual Studio Build Tools installed.
